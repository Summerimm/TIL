# Introduction
- Computers execute **machine code**, sequences of bytes encoding the low-level operations.
  - low-level operation? manipulate data, manage memory, read and write data on storage devices, and communicate over networks

### 코드 실행 순서
1. The **gcc C compiler** generates its output in the form of **assembly
code**
  - assembly code? a textual representation of the machine code giving the individual instructions in the program.
2. Gcc then invokes both an **assembler** and a **linker** to generate
the **executable machine code** from the assembly code.

### Why should we spend our time learning machine code?
- Even though compilers do most of the work in generating assembly code, **being able to read and understand it** is an important skill for serious programmers.
- By reading assembly code, we can **understand the optimization capabilities of the compiler** and **analyze the underlying inefficiencies in the code.**

### Reverse engineering
- In this chapter, we will learn the details of one particular assembly language and see how C programs get compiled into this form of machine code.
- In this case, the system is a machine-generated assembly language
program, rather than something designed by a human.

# 3.1 A Historical Perspective
- based on x86-64, the machine language for most of the processors found in today’s laptop and desktop machines.
